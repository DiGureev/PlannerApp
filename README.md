# PlannerAppRedux

Full-Stack App build with:
* Node.js
* React with hooks,
* Redux. using redux-thunk,
* PostgreSQL Data Base,
* CSS

## Features
Basic planner for myself, where I can add the task, see all tasks, edit or remove the task, mark it as done and remove all plans for the day.
I deployed it on the render.com platform as a full-stack app (server and client together).
